# Mathematics Question Text Classification with Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Multinomial Naïve Bayes (MNB)

## Introduction
This is my Practical Work course research project as a research assistant for Mrs. Hasmawati, S.Kom., M.Kom., one of lecturer in Data Science at School of Computing, Telkom University. The research is about text classification for Mathematics Multiple Choice Questions in elementary, junior high, and senior high schools with machine learning model, i.e. Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Multinomial Naïve Bayes (MNB). The question text is in Bahasa Indonesia. All questions will classify in three categories, i.e. easy, medium, and hard.

## Dataset
The dataset is prepared by lecturer, which consist of Mathematics multiple choice questions for elementary, junior high, and senior high schools. As a research assistant, one of my responsibilities is managed data with removing the duplicates data and invalid questions. Invalid questions contains the senteces or phrases which refer to tables and/or pitcure, e.g. "Perhatikan gambar berikut", "Perhatikan tabel berikut", "Dari gambar disamping", etc. Next, every data needs to be labelled. There are three labels for the question classification, i.e. easy, medium, and hard. There are a guide to label the dataset (Please read the PDF with title "Labelling Guide").
