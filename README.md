# Mathematics Question Text Classification with Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Multinomial Naïve Bayes (MNB)

## Introduction
This is my Practical Work course research project as a research assistant for Mrs. Hasmawati, S.Kom., M.Kom., one of lecturer in Data Science at School of Computing, Telkom University. The research is about text classification for Mathematics Multiple Choice Questions in elementary, junior high, and senior high schools with machine learning model, i.e. Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Multinomial Naïve Bayes (MNB). The question text is in Bahasa Indonesin. All questions will classify in three categories, i.e. easy, medium, and hard.
